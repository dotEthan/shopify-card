## Notes & Issues

- Theme is Dawn, I did not clear out the unneeded files as it seemed like more work than needed, I simply added the files needed and restructured the front page to show them. 

- Only the files I created are using tailwindcss as the base theme was built by Shopify using CSS.

- For some reason the "blue" color swatch is set as blue, but looks VERY purple to me. Will try to fix in the morning.
